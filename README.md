# PlaylistMessage
PlaylistMessage allows you to send short messages in the form of spotify playlists.

Give it a try: [Playlistmessage.com](https://playlistmessage.com).

Idea and Programming: Christian Burtchen (@burtchen). Design: Katharina Mehner (@kida).

## How this works
Start by typing your message and use normal parentheses a delimiters. If you do not use any delimiters, playlistmessage will use every single word as a search string, so for specific phrases such as "in the end" or "let it be", those are required.

When you are happy with the selection, you can create a message on your spotify account. For this, the API needs the corresponding rights to your account. The app never does anything besides write the playlist messages you created into your account, and you can obviously delete them later. The app does not receive any information whatsover on you, your message or your spotify account.

You can share finished playlists through social media. The app does not preload any smart social widgets that might track you, the buttons are just links. But obviously, once you click on any icon and go the site, their terms and conditions apply. Again, there is no tracking here, and you can obviously remove the playlistmessage mention from twitter as well if you wish.

Have fun and enjoy writing playlist messages!
